 * Needs to be called within component initialization, as it uses Svelte's Context API.

 * Gets the context key 'mobile' that is set by the root layout from event.locals.mobile
 * This in turn comes from looking for the string 'mobile' in the user-agent
 *
 * Doing it like this instead of checking a window width allows us to reliably render during SSR (on the server)
 *
 * Actual layout decisions such as hiding elements when they would overflow the screen should still be done via CSS media queries.
 *
 * This is more for stuff that is conditionally rendered but can't be reliably done with CSS. Check for {#if mobile} in the source code for examples.
